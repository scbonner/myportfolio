          <p>Hi. I'm Sadric Bonner, pronounced as (Say-drick). However, most people get it confused with Cedric, and that's okay. I promise my last name is much easier. So have you heard of bonbons, the small sweet confection cakes? Well, the first syllable of my last name is pronounced the same way. Instead of bonbon, it's (Bon-ner). See, that wasn't so hard.</p>
          <p>I consider myself as a life-learner, and I'm very creative at designing knitting, crocheting, painting, dance and so forth. As you continue to view my portfolio you will get to see the professional and digital side of my creativity.  </p>
          <p>The backdrop in designing this portifolio, was to keep it's design simple and focus on "My Story" and "Projects" developed. So continue to move forward and view the rest of the file. And if you would like to contact me, a form is provided for you to enter your information.</p>
