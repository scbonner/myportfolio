          <p> About four years ago, I had the awesome opportunity to supervise and mentor a student studying computer science at the university where I worked. The department had a nonprofit status. It was solely financed and dependent upon outside funding sources though grants or government agencies.</p>
          <p>One of my tasks was to maintain and update a statewide website that included a collaboration with the Juvenile Justice, Mental Health and Substance Use organizations including other non-government agencies. As this collective partnership expanded, so did the need to improve the website. At that time, my technical intellectual capacity was reduced to that of a user.</p>
          <p>I submitted the idea for the department to partner with the university's computer science department. It was a win-win chance to utilize an internal resource that of a student needing volunteer-service hours.Several advantages, I noted in advance: monies saved, receipt of volunteer-service hours including a letter of recommendation, and the ability to address time sensitive deadlines in keeping the information current.</p>
          <p>Upper management agreed, and I made all the contacts to supervise and mentor a seasoned student. It is then, I quickly became intrigued with the possibility of transitioning into a different field.</p>
          <p>Long story short, his services came to an end. The partnership and his efforts saved our department somewhere between 5K to 10K dollars, man-hours cut in half, student received service hour certifiation and a letter of recommendation.</p>
          <p>And, me? Well, I did go back to school for Coding to become a Software Engineer. It was through his encouragement and patience I jumped out on faith to, again, challenge myself.</p>
