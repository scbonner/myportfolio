        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <div id="col">
          <p> My story started around four years ago. I had the great opportunity to mentor and supervise a student at the university I worked. Our department was classified as a nonprofit and operated solely through outside funding sources and a tight budget.
          </p>
          <p>One of my tasks was to maintain and update statewide website that included the departments of the Juvenile Justice, Mental Health and Substance Use staff and other non-governmental agencies. As the collaborative roster grew, so did the state and departmental information needs expand and the website was becoming obsolete. My technological capacities were nonexistent other than UI, designing and sketching of the pages. 
          </p>
          <p>To save money, I suggested a partnership with our computer science department students. It would be a win-win in saving us dollars and they could get their volunteer service hours on their resumes. This mere chance was a game changer for me. As I sketched, observed and verbally instructed the student, I eventually became his student and he, my teacher. He encouraged me to try school again; however, in the technology field.  So, the rest is history. 
          </p>
          <p>I was able to save the department around $10,000 and turn-around time for the time-sensitive updates. The student received a job on my recommendation of a job well done, and me? Well, I did go back to school for Coding and Web Design.
