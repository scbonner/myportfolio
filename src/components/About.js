        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <div id="col">
          <p> About four years ago, I had the great opportunity to supervise and mentor a student at the university I worked. The department I was affliated with was classified as a nonprofit. Funding was solely based on outside grant funding.</p>
          <p>One of my tasks was to monitor and update a statewide collaborative website that included the the Juvenile Justice, Mental Health and Substance Use organizations in addition to other non-government agencies. As the collaborative roster expanded, so did the need to keep the site as current as possible. My digital capacity was nonexistent other than UI manipulation.</p>
          <p>The department's dilemma always surrounded money. Regardless, an upgrade was looming. I suggested a partnership with the university's computer science department. We would utilize the services of a student as a volunteer. It was viewed as a win-win collab effort. Several advantages, it saved money, the student would receive volunteer service hours, and the job could be completed a few weeks ahead of time.</p>
          <p>The group agreed, and I supervised and mentored a student. Quickly, I became intrigued with the enormity and possibilities in the field. Immediately, he began to encourage me to return to school, transitioning into the information technology field.</p>
          <p>The job came to an end. We noticed soon, thereafter, our collabration saved somewhere between 5K to 10K dollars, deadlines were met, the student received volunteer hours. He, also, accepted a position within weeks after assisting us.</p>
          <p>And, me? Well, I did go back to school ransitioning in the field of Coding and Web Design.</p>
